SheepFeed by ArmEagle

A Minecraft, Bukkit plugin that lets you feed sheep so they'll grow back their furry coat.
Some default foods are configured. But you can add your own, or change the stats of the
current food items. If a sheep had its wool colored to non-natural colors, the wool will
grow back white.
